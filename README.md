  date_format = "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M",
})
```

## Completion

Comment input windows support `@user` and `#issue/PR` completion.

### blink.cmp

Add the provider to your blink.cmp config:

```lua
sources = {
  default = { "lsp", "path", "buffer", "snippets", "fude" },
  providers = {
    fude = {
      name = "fude",
      module = "fude.completion.blink",
      score_offset = 50,
      async = true,
    },
  },
},
```

### nvim-cmp

Register the source in your config:

```lua
require("cmp").register_source("fude", require("fude.completion.cmp").new())
```

Then add `{ name = "fude" }` to your nvim-cmp sources.
