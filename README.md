## Completion

Comment input windows support `@user` and `#issue/PR` completion.

### blink.cmp

Add the provider to your blink.cmp config:

```lua
sources = {
  default = { "lsp", "path", "buffer", "snippets", "reviewit" },
  providers = {
    reviewit = {
      name = "reviewit",
      module = "reviewit.completion.blink",
      score_offset = 50,
      async = true,
    },
  },
},
```

### nvim-cmp

Register the source in your config:

```lua
require("cmp").register_source("reviewit", require("reviewit.completion.cmp").new())
```

Then add `{ name = "reviewit" }` to your nvim-cmp sources.
